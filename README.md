> **Scope (Updated 2026-04):** ROAM started as a Robotaxi-focused framework but has expanded to cover **all L4 autonomous mobility operating models** — including Robotaxi fleets, OEM direct fleets, personally-owned L4 with OEM subscription services, shared-use vehicles, public transit, logistics, and specialized environments. See [Operating Models v1.0](taxonomy/operating-models-v1.0.md) for the 10 modes we currently cover.

## Why ROAM?

On March 31, 2026, nearly 100 Baidu Apollo robotaxis simultaneously shut down on elevated highways in Wuhan, China. Passengers were trapped for 2 hours. SOS buttons went unanswered. The only resolution? **Police officers manually rescuing vehicles one by one.**

Three months earlier, a power outage in San Francisco left Waymo vehicles stranded across the city. Emergency services called Waymo's hotline 31 times, waiting a combined 2.5 hours.

These aren't edge cases — they're previews of what happens when L4 autonomous fleets scale without adequate remote operations infrastructure.

In March 2026, a [US Congressional investigation](docs/Markey-Remote-Back-Seat-Operators-Report-2026.pdf) revealed that **all seven major AV companies refused to disclose** how frequently their vehicles require remote human intervention — underscoring the urgent need for independent, open operational transparency.

**ROAM provides the open-source foundation for solving this problem:**

1. 📋 **Incident Database** — Structured, searchable records of every known L4 anomaly
2. 🏷️ **Scenario Taxonomy + Operating Models** — 6 scenario categories + 10 operating modes
3. 🏗️ **Reference Architecture** — Three-layer decision model with mode-specific responsibility matrix
4. 📊 **Evaluation Benchmarks** — Mode-differentiated KPIs and baseline data
5. 🔧 **Technology Pillars** — Six-pillar technical foundation (perception, teleop, wireless, AI trust, cybersecurity, human factors)
6. 📜 **Standards Roadmap** — Three-tier proposal path to formalize ROAM as a group / national / international standard ([`standards/`](standards/))

## L4 is Not Only Robotaxi

The future of L4 autonomous mobility is far more diverse than today's Robotaxi-centric picture. ROAM covers **10 operating models** across four categories:

| Category | Modes |
|---------|-------|
| **Commercial Operations** | M1 Robotaxi Operator · M2 OEM Direct Fleet · M3 Fleet-as-a-Service |
| **Personal Ownership** | M4 Personal + OEM Subscription · M5 Personal + Shared · M6 Pure Private L4 |
| **Public Transit** | M7 L4 Bus · M8 Micro-Transit Shuttle |
| **Specialized Environments** | M9 Last-Mile Delivery · M10 Restricted Environment (mine/port/airport) |

A critical insight: in modes M4–M6, **OEMs transition from manufacturers to service providers**, inheriting remote operations responsibility for privately-owned vehicles. ROAM's responsibility matrix formalizes this shift.

See [`taxonomy/operating-models-v1.0.md`](taxonomy/operating-models-v1.0.md) for full definitions.

```

### Reference Architecture

See [`architecture/reference-architecture.md`](architecture/reference-architecture.md) for the three-layer decision model:

```
Layer 1: AI Autonomous Response     (target: 70% of anomalies)

## Regulatory Alignment

ROAM is designed to support compliance efforts across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. Three regulatory frameworks are of particular relevance:

**China GB ADS Safety Requirements (Appendix C.2 — Remote Assistance)**
The draft GB standard's Appendix C.2 defines functional requirements for L4 remote assistance, including communication latency thresholds, operator qualification, and fallback procedures. ROAM's three-layer architecture (AI Autonomous / AI-Assisted + Human / Remote Driving) directly maps to the GB standard's graduated remote intervention model. ROAM's Incident Database provides the operational evidence required for the Safety Case (安全档案) structure defined in Appendix D.

**WP.29 GTR Safety Case Requirements**
The GRVA draft Global Technical Regulation requires manufacturers to demonstrate that their ADS performs at least as safely as a "competent and careful human driver." ROAM's Benchmarks module provides quantitative KPIs (response time, resolution rate, escalation frequency) that support this demonstration. ROAM's Incident Database offers structured records that feed into the evidence base of manufacturer safety cases.

**Germany StVFernLV Teleoperation Framework**
Germany's Road Traffic Remote Driving Ordinance (December 2025) is Europe's first comprehensive legal framework for teleoperated driving. It specifies operator training requirements, communication infrastructure standards, and operational constraints. ROAM's Architecture Layer 3 (Remote Driving / On-Site) aligns with these requirements, and ROAM's Benchmarks include communication performance KPIs that map to StVFernLV's minimum bandwidth and latency mandates.

**US Congressional Investigation: Markey RAOS Report (March 2026)**
Senator Markey's [Remote Back Seat Operators report](docs/Markey-Remote-Back-Seat-Operators-Report-2026.pdf) is the first Congressional investigation into AV remote assistance operations. Key findings: all 7 companies refused to disclose RAO intervention frequency; cross-company latency ranged from 100ms to 500ms with no federal standard; Waymo uses overseas RAOs (Philippines) without US driver's licenses. Markey announced plans for legislation establishing federal RAO standards — reinforcing the need for ROAM's open, evidence-based benchmarks.
