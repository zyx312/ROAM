## Why ROAM?

On March 31, 2026, nearly 100 Baidu Apollo robotaxis simultaneously shut down on elevated highways in Wuhan, China. Passengers were trapped for 2 hours. SOS buttons went unanswered. The only resolution? **Police officers manually rescuing vehicles one by one.**

Three months earlier, a power outage in San Francisco left Waymo vehicles stranded across the city. Emergency services called Waymo's hotline 31 times, waiting a combined 2.5 hours.

These aren't edge cases — they're previews of what happens when L4 robotaxi fleets scale without adequate remote operations infrastructure.

**ROAM provides the open-source foundation for solving this problem:**

1. 📋 **Incident Database** — Structured, searchable records of every known robotaxi anomaly
2. 🏷️ **Scenario Taxonomy** — 6 categories, 20+ sub-scenarios for classifying operational anomalies
3. 🏗️ **Reference Architecture** — Three-layer decision model for AI-first remote operations
4. 📊 **Evaluation Benchmarks** — KPIs and baseline data for measuring platform performance

## Who Is This For?

| Audience | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Robotaxi Operators** (Baidu, Pony.ai, WeRide) | Reference architecture for building remote ops platforms |
| **OEMs** (SAIC, FAW, Changan) | Scenario database for L4 service planning |
| **Startups** building teleops solutions | Open baseline to build upon, not from scratch |
| **Regulators & Standards Bodies** | Evidence-based incident data for policy development |

## Quick Start

### Browse Incidents

Each incident is a YAML file in `incidents/YYYY/`:

```bash
ls incidents/2026/
# ROAM-2026-001-waymo-santa-monica-child.yaml
# ROAM-2026-002-waymo-austin-ambulance.yaml
# ROAM-2026-003-waymo-sf-two-vehicle-collision.yaml
# ROAM-2026-004-apollo-wuhan-mass-shutdown.yaml
# ...
```

### Understand the Taxonomy

See [`taxonomy/scenario-taxonomy-v1.0.md`](taxonomy/scenario-taxonomy-v1.0.md) for the full classification:

```
A. System-Wide Failure          (系统性故障)
B. Perception/Decision Failure  (感知/决策失效)
C. Planning/Execution Anomaly   (规划/执行异常)
D. Vehicle Hardware Failure     (车辆硬件故障)
E. External Conflict            (外部环境冲突)
F. Passenger-Side Issue         (乘客端异常)
```

### Reference Architecture

See [`architecture/reference-architecture.md`](architecture/reference-architecture.md) for the three-layer decision model:

```
Layer 1: AI Autonomous Response     (target: 70% of anomalies)
Layer 2: AI-Assisted + Human Confirm (target: 25%)
Layer 3: Remote Driving / On-Site    (target: 5%)
```

## Regulatory Alignment

ROAM is designed to support compliance efforts across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. Three regulatory frameworks are of particular relevance:

**China GB ADS Safety Requirements (Appendix C.2 — Remote Assistance)**
The draft GB standard's Appendix C.2 defines functional requirements for L4 remote assistance, including communication latency thresholds, operator qualification, and fallback procedures. ROAM's three-layer architecture (AI Autonomous / AI-Assisted + Human / Remote Driving) directly maps to the GB standard's graduated remote intervention model. ROAM's Incident Database provides the operational evidence required for the Safety Case (安全档案) structure defined in Appendix D.

**WP.29 GTR Safety Case Requirements**
The GRVA draft Global Technical Regulation requires manufacturers to demonstrate that their ADS performs at least as safely as a "competent and careful human driver." ROAM's Benchmarks module provides quantitative KPIs (response time, resolution rate, escalation frequency) that support this demonstration. ROAM's Incident Database offers structured records that feed into the evidence base of manufacturer safety cases.

**Germany StVFernLV Teleoperation Framework**
Germany's Road Traffic Remote Driving Ordinance (December 2025) is Europe's first comprehensive legal framework for teleoperated driving. It specifies operator training requirements, communication infrastructure standards, and operational constraints. ROAM's Architecture Layer 3 (Remote Driving / On-Site) aligns with these requirements, and ROAM's Benchmarks include communication performance KPIs that map to StVFernLV's minimum bandwidth and latency mandates.
