# ROAM Reference Architecture: Three-Layer Remote Operations Platform

**Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-04
**Status:** Initial Release

---

## Important Notice

This is a **reference architecture** — a starting point, not a prescription. Companies should customize this for their specific ADS technology stack, fleet size, regulatory environment, and operational maturity. The layer boundaries, automation targets, and escalation logic described here represent what we consider best practice based on analysis of known incidents, but every deployment has unique constraints.

## 1. Architecture Overview

The ROAM Reference Architecture defines a three-layer decision model for handling robotaxi operational anomalies. The core principle: **AI handles routine anomalies autonomously; humans handle the exceptions.**

   Target:          70%                     25%                    5%

   Latency:      < 2 seconds             < 60 seconds          < 5 minutes

   Human:           None                 Confirm/Override     Direct Control
```

### Design Principles

1. **AI-First, Human-on-Exception** — The default path is autonomous resolution. Human operators are a scarce, expensive resource reserved for situations that genuinely require judgment.
2. **Fail-Safe Defaults** — When in doubt, the system chooses the conservative option (stop, pull over, unlock doors) rather than waiting for human input.
3. **Graceful Degradation** — If Layer 1 cannot resolve, it escalates to Layer 2. If Layer 2 cannot resolve, it escalates to Layer 3. No anomaly should fall through all layers without response.
4. **Time-Bounded Escalation** — Each layer has a maximum resolution time. Exceeding it triggers automatic escalation to the next layer.
5. **Passenger Communication at Every Layer** — Regardless of which layer handles the anomaly, the passenger receives status updates.

---

## 2. Layer 1: AI Autonomous Response (AI自主响应)

**Target:** 70% of all anomalies
**Latency:** < 2 seconds from detection to action
**Human Involvement:** None

### 2.1 What Layer 1 Handles

Layer 1 handles anomalies where the correct response is deterministic or where a conservative default is always safe:

| Scenario | Layer 1 Action |
|----------|---------------|
| B1 — Intersection hesitation | Timeout -> conservative proceed or reroute |
| B2 — Object misidentification | Treat as solid obstacle, conservative path |
| B3 — Weather degradation | Graduated ODD restriction -> safe stop |
| B4 — Abnormal human behavior | Conservative yield/stop |
| B5 — Localization drift | Speed reduction -> safe stop |
| C2 — Unexpected braking | Post-event logging (no real-time intervention possible) |
| C3 — Dangerous lane change | Abort -> return to original lane |
| C4 — Static object collision | Emergency stop, post-collision protocol |
| C5 — Pedestrian collision | Emergency stop, auto-notify emergency services |
| D1 — Sensor failure | Redundancy failover, ODD restriction |
| D4 — Actuator failure | Redundant actuator failover, safe stop |
| E1 — Struck by other vehicle | Post-collision protocol |
| F2 — Dangerous pickup/dropoff | Select from validated safe point database |

### 2.2 Decision Flow

```

### 2.3 Adaptive Trust Calibration for AI Decisions

Layer 1 relies on AI to make autonomous decisions without human oversight. A critical question is: how does the system know when its own AI decisions are becoming unreliable? Drawing on the trust calibration approach proposed by C-TRAIL [Cui et al., IEEE Trans. Vehicular Technology, 2026], ROAM recommends an **Adaptive Trust Calibration** mechanism for Layer 1 decision quality monitoring.

**Dual Trust Dimensions:**

- **Commonsense Trust** (T_cs): Does the AI's proposed action align with expected traffic behavior? For example, accelerating toward a red light or routing through a clearly blocked road would violate commonsense expectations and reduce T_cs.
- **Kinematic Trust** (T_kin): Is the proposed action physically feasible given the vehicle's current state? Proposed trajectories that exceed steering limits, require impossible deceleration rates, or violate vehicle dynamics constraints would reduce T_kin.

**Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Trust Update:**

```
T(t) = alpha * T(t-1) + (1 - alpha) * R(t)

where:
  T(t)   = trust score at time step t
  alpha  = decay factor (0 < alpha < 1)
  R(t)   = reward signal from latest decision outcome
```

**Reward-Adaptive Decay:** The decay factor alpha is not fixed but adapts to decision quality:

- **High reward** (correct resolution, no incident): alpha remains high (e.g., 0.95), maintaining accumulated trust
- **Low reward** (incorrect action, near-miss, passenger complaint): alpha decreases (e.g., 0.7), accelerating trust decay
- **Negative reward** (safety-critical error): alpha drops sharply (e.g., 0.3), rapidly eroding trust

**Escalation Trigger:** When the composite trust score T = w_cs * T_cs + w_kin * T_kin falls below a configurable safety threshold (e.g., T < 0.6), the system automatically escalates subsequent anomalies to Layer 2 for human confirmation, even if they would normally be handled by Layer 1. Trust recovery occurs gradually as Layer 2-confirmed decisions demonstrate consistent quality.

**Application in Remote Operations:**

| Trust State | System Behavior |
|-------------|----------------|
| T >= 0.8 (High) | Layer 1 operates normally with full autonomy |
| 0.6 <= T < 0.8 (Medium) | Layer 1 operates with enhanced logging and monitoring |
| T < 0.6 (Low) | Auto-escalate to Layer 2; Layer 1 restricted to fail-safe defaults only |
| T < 0.3 (Critical) | Fleet-wide alert; all decisions require human confirmation |

This mechanism ensures that when AI decision quality degrades -- whether due to distribution shift, sensor degradation, environmental changes, or software defects -- the system self-corrects by routing more decisions to human operators rather than continuing to execute potentially unreliable autonomous actions.

### 2.4 Key Requirements

- **On-board fallback logic**: Vehicles must be able to execute Layer 1 actions WITHOUT cloud connectivity (edge-cached decision logic)
- **Scenario classifier accuracy**: >95% correct primary scenario classification
- **Action library**: Pre-programmed action sequences for each Layer 1 scenario
- **Passenger notification**: Automated in-vehicle messages for relevant events (e.g., "Your vehicle is rerouting due to road construction")
- **Trust monitoring**: Continuous trust score computation with configurable escalation thresholds

---

## 3. Layer 2: AI-Assisted + Human Confirm (AI辅助 + 人工确认)

**Target:** 25% of all anomalies
**Latency:** < 60 seconds from escalation to resolution
**Human Involvement:** Operator reviews AI recommendation and confirms/modifies

### 3.1 What Layer 2 Handles

Layer 2 handles anomalies where AI can propose a solution but human judgment is needed for confirmation:

| Scenario | AI Proposal | Operator Role |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| A2 — OTA failure | Recommend rollback | Confirm rollback scope |
| A3 — Infrastructure failure | Propose fleet reroute | Confirm geo-fence boundary |
| C1 — Mid-road freeze | Plot exit path | Confirm path is safe |
| D2 — Powertrain failure | Route to nearest safe stop | Confirm recovery dispatch |
| E2 — Construction zone | Propose reroute | Confirm if ambiguous flaggers |
| E3 — Emergency vehicle | Propose yield maneuver | Confirm appropriate response |
| E4 — Police gesture | Interpret gesture, propose action | Confirm via camera feed |
| F1 — Passenger trapped | Propose door unlock | Verify safe to open doors |
| F3 — Passenger interference | Propose intercom message | Deliver and escalate if needed |

### 3.2 Escalation Triggers (Layer 1 -> Layer 2)

Layer 1 escalates to Layer 2 when:

1. **Timeout** — Layer 1 action did not resolve anomaly within time limit (scenario-specific, typically 30-120 seconds)
2. **Low confidence** — AI classifier confidence below threshold (e.g., <80% for scenario classification)
3. **Novel scenario** — No matching Layer 1 handler found
4. **Multi-factor** — Anomaly involves multiple concurrent scenario codes
5. **Passenger-initiated** — Passenger pressed SOS or called support

### 3.3 Operator Workflow

```
  Escalation arrives in operator queue
       |
       v
  +-----------------------------------+
  | Alert Panel                        |
  | - Vehicle ID, location (map)       |
  | - Live camera feeds (4+ angles)    |
  | - Scenario classification          |
  | - AI recommended action            |
  | - Severity/Urgency assessment      |
  | - Passenger status                 |
  +-----------------------------------+
       |
       v
  Operator reviews (target: <30 seconds)
       |
       +--- Agree with AI recommendation --> Confirm (one-click)
       |
       +--- Modify recommendation --> Adjust parameters, confirm
       |
       +--- Override with different action --> Select from action menu
       |
       +--- Escalate to Layer 3 --> Remote driving / dispatch request
       |
       v
  Action executed on vehicle
       |
       v
  Operator verifies outcome via camera/telemetry
       |
       v
  Close incident or escalate to Layer 3
```

### 3.4 Key Requirements

- **Operator interface**: Single-screen dashboard with live video, map, telemetry, and action controls
- **AI recommendation quality**: >80% of AI recommendations accepted by operator without modification
- **Queue management**: Priority queuing based on Urgency level (U3 preempts all)
- **Communication tools**: Two-way intercom with passenger, text messaging, pre-recorded announcements
- **Decision audit trail**: Every operator decision logged with timestamp, context, and rationale

---

## 4. Layer 3: Remote Driving / On-Site (远程驾驶 / 现场处置)

**Target:** 5% of all anomalies
**Latency:** < 5 minutes from escalation to intervention start
**Human Involvement:** Direct human control of vehicle or physical on-site presence

### 4.1 What Layer 3 Handles

Layer 3 is the last resort — situations that cannot be resolved by automated action or operator commands:

| Scenario | Layer 3 Action |
|----------|---------------|
| A1 — Mass cloud failure (recovery) | Coordinated fleet reactivation |
| C1 — Freeze (unresponsive to commands) | Remote driving to safe location |
| D3 — Vehicle fire | Emergency services coordination, on-site |
| F4 — Medical emergency | Emergency dispatch + hospital routing |
| E3 — Active emergency scene (complex) | On-site coordinator |
| Tow truck dispatch | Physical vehicle recovery |

### 4.2 When Layer 3 Is Needed

Layer 3 is triggered when:

1. **Remote driving required** — Vehicle is in a position where only direct human driving control can move it safely (e.g., frozen in complex intersection, no automated path available)
2. **Physical intervention required** — Hardware failure requiring tow, door mechanism jammed, vehicle fire
3. **Emergency services coordination** — Fatality, serious injury, or fire requires on-site incident commander
4. **Fleet-wide crisis** — Mass failure requiring coordinated recovery of 10+ vehicles

### 4.3 Remote Driving Operations

  +------------------------------------------------------------+

  Requirements:
  - Network latency: < 150ms round-trip (hard cutoff: 300ms -> auto-stop)
  - Video resolution: 1080p minimum, 30fps minimum
  - Redundant network path (4G + 5G or dual carrier)
  - Operator certification: remote driving license + AV-specific training
```

### 4.4 On-Site Dispatch

For scenarios requiring physical presence:

| Dispatch Type | Response Time Target | Scenarios |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Recovery vehicle (tow) | < 30 minutes | C1 (unrecoverable freeze), D2, D4 |
| Mobile technician | < 45 minutes | D1 (sensor replacement), general hardware |
| Emergency services (911/119) | < 5 minutes | D3 (fire), F4 (medical), C5 (pedestrian injury) |
| Security personnel | < 20 minutes | F3 (passenger threat), vandalism |
| On-site coordinator | < 30 minutes | A1 (mass failure recovery), complex multi-vehicle |

## 8. Deployment Considerations

### 8.1 Scaling

| Fleet Size | Recommended Operators (Layer 2) | Remote Drivers (Layer 3) | Target Ratio |
|-----------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 50 vehicles | 2-3 | 1 | 1:20 |
| 200 vehicles | 5-8 | 2-3 | 1:30 |
| 1,000 vehicles | 15-25 | 5-8 | 1:50 |
| 5,000+ vehicles | 50-80 | 15-20 | 1:80 |

Note: These ratios assume Layer 1 resolves 70%+ of anomalies. If Layer 1 resolution rate is lower, more operators are needed.

### 8.2 Network Requirements

| Parameter | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Uplink bandwidth (per vehicle) | 2 Mbps | 10 Mbps |
| Downlink bandwidth (per vehicle) | 500 Kbps | 2 Mbps |
| Round-trip latency (vehicle-cloud) | < 200ms | < 100ms |
| Round-trip latency (remote driving) | < 300ms | < 150ms |
| Network availability | 99.9% | 99.99% |
| Redundant network paths | 1 (4G or 5G) | 2 (4G + 5G or dual carrier) |

### 8.3 Customization Guidance

This reference architecture should be adapted for:

1. **Regulatory environment** — Some jurisdictions require human-in-the-loop for all operational decisions; others allow autonomous operation with remote monitoring only.
2. **ADS capability** — More capable ADS shifts the Layer 1/2 boundary (more scenarios handled autonomously).
3. **Service area** — Urban vs. suburban vs. highway deployments have different scenario frequency profiles.
4. **Fleet size** — Small fleets (<50 vehicles) may not need a dedicated Decision Engine; large fleets (>1000) need distributed architecture.
5. **Technology stack** — The API endpoints, message formats, and integration patterns should match your existing platform.

## 9. Human Roles & Responsibilities

This section aligns ROAM's three-layer architecture with Koopman's six-role framework for human participation in automated driving systems [1]. Koopman identifies six distinct roles (Operator, Supervisor, Decider, Responder, Standby, Maintainer), each with on-site and remote variants, yielding twelve role combinations. This taxonomy complements ROAM's decision-flow-based architecture by addressing personnel organization.

### 9.1 Role-to-Layer Mapping

| Koopman Role | Description | ROAM Layer | Location | Safety Responsibility |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Operator** | Continuous control loop (steering, braking) | Layer 3 | Remote (teleoperation) / On-site (chase vehicle) | Full driver-equivalent liability |
| **Supervisor** | Monitors automation, intervenes proactively | Across all layers | Remote monitoring station | Intervention responsibility |
| **Decider** | Responds to AI queries, approves/rejects plans | **Layer 2 (primary)** | Remote (operations center) | Decision-scope liability |
| **Responder** | Handles incidents outside normal operation | **Layer 3 (primary)** | On-site dispatch + remote support | Situational judgment responsibility |
| **Standby** | On-call to fill any role | Orchestration layer | Remote pool + on-site mobile teams | Availability and alertness |
| **Maintainer** | Diagnostics, repair, readiness | Orthogonal to ROAM layers | Depot (on-site) + remote diagnostics | Maintenance quality |

### 9.2 Legal Accountability Principles

Following Koopman's argument, all human participants in remote operations bear safety responsibility commensurate with their role:

- **Layer 2 Deciders** are NOT merely "assistants" — their decisions on traffic signal interpretation, object classification, and path approval directly affect ADS behavior and are legitimate DDT components.
- **Layer 3 Operators and Responders** carry driver-equivalent or incident-commander responsibilities.
- The ROAM architecture explicitly rejects the "accountability laundering" position that AI computers bear legal responsibility — legal persons (individuals and employers) must be identifiable and accountable.

### 9.3 Staffing Implications

Integrating the role framework with ROAM's scaling table (Section 8.1):

| Fleet Size | Layer 2 Deciders | Layer 3 Operators/Responders | Standby Pool | Maintainers |
|-----------|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 50 vehicles | 2-3 | 1-2 | 2 (cross-trained) | 1-2 (depot) |
| 200 vehicles | 5-8 | 3-4 | 5 (tiered pools) | 3-5 (depot + remote) |
| 1,000 vehicles | 15-25 | 8-12 | 15+ (24/7 rotation) | 15-20 (multi-depot) |

Note: Cross-training Standby personnel across multiple roles enables efficient resource utilization but requires robust qualification management.

### 9.4 Orthogonality to SAE Levels

Koopman explicitly notes that these role assignments are independent of SAE J3016 L0-L5 classification [1]. A nominally L4 system may still require:
- Operators during testing phases
- Remote Deciders during daily operations (Layer 2)
- On-Scene Responders for incident management (Layer 3)

Any claim that "L4 means no humans involved" misrepresents real-world operational requirements.
